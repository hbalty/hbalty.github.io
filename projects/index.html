            C’diffusion is a web application dedicated to Cdiscount teams to report any incident that can occur in the company’s infrastructure. I was charged to design and develop this application to meet with support team needs.
            Agility, precision and disponibility were the main challenged i had to consider working on this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            This application main purpose is to keep track of all incidents that is happening or had happened in the company. These allows teams to measure a risk of a change to be done. The second functionality is to notify anyone that had been impacted by an incident and that’s in real time using text messages or emails.
        </p>
        <p>
            To maintain a good disponibility of the application (even in case of incident within the local network),
            the application was hosted on a Microsoft Azure server and users can log in using there Azure AD credentials.
